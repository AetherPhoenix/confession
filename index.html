            <h1>Confession</h1>
            <h2>Confessing to someone na loyal sa kanilang religion</h2> <be>

                <p>04-10-23, the day I wrote this confession for you, mr. annoying. this is weird I know, confessing to someone na super loyal to their religion and to someone that I'm same class with. i am actually not giving attention to someone, i only caught my attention to you when we have a performance task on mapeh. my friends said that I should asked you to be my partner on that but I'm shy of course. I'm shocked when you message me and asking me if I have a partner na. I'm not happy about that either, I'm still cursing that performance task because of that my friends are shipping us for almost a days. I'm thinking if you didn't asked me to do that performance task maybe I'm still not paying attention to you. maybe I still don't know who are you. mapeh performance task is not a good idea pa rin, I thought the shipping thing will pass after days but no, I'm wrong. sitting arrangement in science, we are inches apart lang no'n, right? my friends eyes is always looking at me, they're teasing me especially Xina. I mean, we're just only seatmate??? nilalagyan nila malisya and inaano nila ako na crush daw kita, like wth? that day I'm starting to question myself if I have a crush on you nga ba, because I doubt it, I didn't feel anything that makes me kilig or ano. skip skip skip, and the shipping thing starts.... i was pushing you no'n because you got a higher score on test ata, I mean, it's nothing to me but they started to looked at me like I did something wrong. almost everyday na nga ata ang shipping thing eh. nakakarindi kaya na laging tinatawag ang surname ko kahit na anong gawin ko puro surname ko at surname mo eh, mag recite lang isisigaw na agad surname mo hays. i can't come closer to you tuloy because when I'll come closer to you they started to ship and teasing us. February something we started to talk, you messaged me no'n about acads which is make me so shocked. like, I didn't expect you to message me though it's acads related naman so it's fine. you messaged me again and asking me to play ml, eh i don't have ml that time, but for you I downloaded it just to play hshshd I don't know why I did that either. it's just that inside of me said that I should play with you. lah, anue ka special? niweys, after that we talked like we were friends. i thought you are very serious and mysterious person because of your aura but then when I started to talk to you, you're annoying so much. you're always teasing me like duh, we're not even close. second quarter giving awards, when ma'am Jenny is calling our names they're shouting our surname, shipping us again. ako pa ang pinagsabit ng medal mo hays. heh, I'm still not happy about that hmp. I'm still embarrassed that time hdnsks, my family saw that and start to tease me in the house. is this still a confession or a story? HAHAHA <br class="margin1">
            I feel like you're bored reading this na, or you didn't read it at all. so okay, confession start now hihi. It might be surprising, but my feelings for you are super special. I think you have a spark that attracts me. I don't know since when I started to like you, I mean i don't know the exact day. maybe when the shipping thing started? maybe when we started talking? or i don't know. the only thing i know for sure is it's just 'happy crush' before. you're always asking me who's my crush before but I can't say it because it's you, idiot. i even tell to myself that I will never fell for you, hanggang crush lang. but things happened, i am here writing a confession letter to you, i have feelings for you. i know it's wrong liking someone with my opposite religion, especially you're a INC and I am Catholic. you're religion have so many rules, and i know you don't want to break that rules especially the golden rule. i am not hoping in return, i just want you to know and be aware to my feelings (pero medj umaasa ehem). since the day I found that I have feelings for you, i am always waiting for your messages, waiting for you in the hallway, admiring you from afar, and looking for you even in the midst of the crowd. i wrote a poem for you too, but I won't tell. i started to pay attention on you, in the little things you do. whenever you're smiling, talking, and even laughing it feels like a sound to my ear and a beautiful view in my eyes. (cringe ik) whenever I'm sad, you're there, comforting me in the things that you can do. saying to me that "kapag need mo ng kausap, nandito lang ako" makes my heart flutter. your random messages, your good morning and good night's, I'm always receiving this to someone who's in the past and now, I'm receiving it again from you. you're special to me now, kiel. (wow first name) not only because i have a feelings for you, 'cause you are a good classmate to me. I'm so lucky that the top 1 in the class is talking to me, i even fall to this person what a life. this is my first time writing a confession essay to someone heh, not my first confession though only on writing essay confession because last time I fall to someone I confess using a song hdksbd. if ever you're telling this to your friends, please don't. just keep it to yourself, don't tell it to anyone. honestly you're not in my type, but here I am confessing to you. i know we're only talking for months, i know i have an attachment issue, i know I'm falling too fast. but who wouldn't fall if you're giving a signals? a mixed signals hehe. in this time, we should still knowing each other eh. believe me or not, I tried to stop my feelings, I really tried. it's just that i can't stop it. i am always feeling guilty, why? because I shouldn't like you. I'm scared to confess, because one time you said that if someone confessed to you, you'll make them cry first before rejecting them. I don't know know if you mean it but hope you'll not gonna do that to me, because you know hdhs so I have an idea that I'll write an 5k worth essay confession to you. and now I'm giving this confession to you. sorry for falling, and thank you for everything. just like what i said, I am not expecting in return. i hope nothing changes between us, no awkwardness and please I hope we can still be friends. words aren't enough, writing essay worth 5k words is also not enough just to express that I like you, I sincerely do. </p>
